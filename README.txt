DESCRIPTION

  This program is (for now) a simple log-odds calculator. It does not do much
  else yet, and will eventually have more utility in the prediction of U12
  introns.

INPUT

  The input for now is the input.matrix file, which contains the frequencies of
  each nucleotide at a given position (1-5, in the example case).

OUTPUT

  The output from the program is a matrix like the input showing the PWM scores
  of the given nucleotides at each position.
