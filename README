DESCRIPTION

  This program is meant to find and predict U12 introns.

CLONING

  Make sure to use --recursive when cloning the git repository; otherwise you
  will need to manually initialize the submodules in the lib directory.

INPUT

  Specify 3 PWM files (.tsv), a GTF file, and a FASTA file in that order as
  command-line arguments. Run without arguments for more details.

OUTPUT

  TBD

BUILDING

  This program requires a C++17-compatible compiler, and if you have GNU Make
  installed, you can use the Makefile to compile it.

LIBRARIES

  This program uses the following external dependencies (represented as
  submodules in this repository):
    - gtf-cpp for GTF parsing (github/willeccles/gtf-cpp)
    - fasta-cpp for FASTA parsing (github/willeccles/gtf-cpp)
    - pdqsort to sort arrays quickly without relying on std::sort (github/orlp/pdqsort)
