PREDICTION

The first way you can use this program is to predict which introns in a FASTA
file are U12-type introns based on 3 input PWM files and one GTF file. This can
be done by using the following arguments to the program:

  <executablename> [3' pwm] [5' pwm] [B' pwm] [gtf] [fasta]
    
    - [3' pwm] is a PWM in a TSV file, downloaded from the splice rack to be
                used for the 3'ss
    - [5' pwm] is a PWM in a TSV file, downloaded from the splice rack to be
                used for the 5'ss
    - [B' pwm] is a PWM in a TSV file, downloaded from the splice rack to be
                used to find the breakpoint
    - [gtf]    is the GTF file corresponding to the FASTA file, where exons will
                be read from.
    - [fasta]  is the FASTA file to read the introns from

*This method is a work in progress, so do not expect it to return useful data!

PARSING

The second way to use this program is to simply parse the introns from the FASTA
file given a GTF file. This is simpler, but any further computations on the
introns themselves are the responsibility of the user. This will output the
given introns into a file, which will be overwritten should it not exist.

  <executablename> [gtf] [fasta]

    - [gtf]    is the GTF file to be used to locate introns
    - [fasta]  is the FASTA file to search for introns

Like the prediction function, this will output the introns' sequences to a
fasta file and their annotation data to a GTF file.

*Note that this program will not remove U2 type introns. All introns will remain
in the output.
